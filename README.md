# Stolen Lands

## Overview:

Game inspired by Pathfinder adventure path: Kingmaker.  In running Kingmaker we ran a side game where a player controls all the bandits in the word to create a more immersive experience for the party.

This project is an attempt to flesh this part of the game out into a coherent, playable experience.

## Project goals:

The goal of this project is to learn and improve as programmers by creating something new.

* Learn
* Use best practice (Extreme programming, do not re-invent the wheel)
* Use recent tech
* Ship something (Be AGILE)
