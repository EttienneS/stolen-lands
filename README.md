## Overview

Game inspired by Pathfinder adventure path: Kingmaker.  In running Kingmaker we ran a side game where a player controls all the bandits in the world to create a more immersive experience for the primary player party.

This project is an attempt to flesh this part of the game out into a coherent, playable experience.
